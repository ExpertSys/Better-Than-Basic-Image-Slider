# Better-Than-Basic-Image-Slider
Buttons to navigate + Pause on image tab selection

All HTML Images must have the class "mySlides" in order to get it connected with the slider.

The slider buttons should have the class "slide-inactive" or rename it as you please.

The slider buttons in the html should have onclick="currentSlide(indexNumber)" (1),(2), etc for example.
